# Applications Tracker

## Problem Statement
Lately, I have been applying for many roles, and it has become a hard task to keep track of all the applications. Spreadsheets are a great way to store this data, but we understand how hard it becomes to check it regularly. We all like how **Mobile Applications** are so efficient to use and increase the accessibility, and so seem the appropriate solution to this problem.

## Proposed Solution
So this is an attempt to make our lives easier, a dedicated app to store job applications only. All the roles that you apply for, **add** them up inside the app, mark if you are **waiting for a referral**, or have you **applied** or not, and get **regular notifications** to remind you about this status, so that you don't keep waiting for the referral the next time you apply. You can easily make changes to applications' data and/or even delete them whenever needed.

## Functionality and Concepts Used
App has a simple and intuitive user interface, that allows users to add data about their applications, they can edit the applications and even delete them whenever needed. The app makes use of Android Jetpack. Jetpack is a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the code they care about. 

In this project following libraries are used -
| Library | Used For|
|---------|:--------|
|[Constraint Layout](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/constraintlayout)|Most activities make use of constraint layout, which is easy to handle with different screen sizes.|
|[Recycler View](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview)|To display list of all the applications that user has added, we use recycler view, which is the best practice to display long lists.|
|[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation)|Navigation between all the present screens is handled using Navigation Library which makes it easier to handle fragment transactions, and to pass the data between them.|
|[Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)|Data is being stored inside SQLite database, and Room library makes it easier to work with all these database related stuff.|
|[Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)|We are using LiveData to update and observe live changes in the applications that user has added. Screens are updated in real time and user is able to track the applications.|
|[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work)|We are using WorkManager to provide periodic notifications to the user, depending upon the status of their applications. Using WorkManager, we are assured that user is notified regularly.|

## Features
This app basically targets job seekers, and it has been created keeping this audience in mind. Being a single person, this app might seem to have a lack of important features but that can be resolved if you guys suggest improvements. 
Meanwhile, the app has the following features - 

1.  **Add Applications**
	* The app provides user a **simple UI** asking just the information that is actually relevant.
	* User can also **add status** of their application, this becomes **the basis of sending the notifications**. 
	* Depending on the status, applications are given a **colored badge** that makes it easier for the user to identify the applications and **enhances user experience**.<br>
	> **Notification Frequency**
	>	<br>Waiting for Referral - Every 6 hours
	>	<br>Applied - Every 15 days
	>	<br>Applied with Referral - Every 30 days

3. **Draft Messages and Placeholders**
	* Latest version of the app let's users to add **Draft Messages**, which you can used as a way to **to ask for referral**.
	* There is a concept of **placeholders** which makes it easier to reuse the informations that is required most of the time.
	> **Placeholders** actually refer to certain reusable key-value pairs that you can add inside your draft messages and they are parsed before message is sent. You can see the **message preview** before sending it.<br>
	> For some of the placeholders (like &lt;name&gt;, &lt;resume&gt;, etc.), you can add custom values that are saved inside your device, while &lt;job-link&gt; is always replaced with the job link that you add in your application.

## Screenshots
The app comes with both Light and Dark themes. Soft colors and a minimalist design are used, hence enhancing user experience. Screenshots of the screens created so far are added below - 
> I don't think there are any more screens that need to be created, I have built all the screens and we will work on fixing issues and adding features.
